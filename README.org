This is a bunch of stuff that I use to attempt to train myself
in chess.

The pieces are Lichess's "Kosal" set. The are available here:
https://github.com/lichess-org/lila/tree/master/public/piece/kosal
and are licensed as AGPL.

Dependencies:
- libraylib
- cl-raylib:

#+begin_src 
git clone https://github.com/longlene/cl-raylib.git ~/.quicklisp/local-projects/cl-raylib
#+end_src
